# 🌿 Plant Disease Recognition System

**Website:** *(Link to your deployed Streamlit App goes here, e.g., `https://your-app-name.streamlit.app`)*

A web application that helps users identify 38 different plant diseases from images. It uses a deep learning model built with TensorFlow/Keras and a Streamlit frontend to provide fast and accurate predictions.

## ✨ Features

* **📈 High-Accuracy Model:** A deep CNN trained on over 70,000 images, achieving **94.6% validation accuracy**.
* **🌳 38 Classes:** Identifies a wide variety of diseases across 14 different plant types, including Apple, Corn, Grape, Potato, and Tomato.
* **📷 Interactive Web App:** An easy-to-use Streamlit interface allows users to upload their own plant leaf images and receive instant predictions.
* **📊 Detailed Evaluation:** Model performance is thoroughly analyzed with accuracy/loss plots, a per-class classification report, and a confusion matrix.

## Model Architecture

The core of this project is a Sequential CNN model built with `tensorflow.keras`.

* **Input Shape:** `(128, 128, 3)`
* **Architecture:**
    1.  **Block 1:** Conv2D (32 filters, 3x3) -> Conv2D (32 filters, 3x3) -> MaxPool2D (2x2)
    2.  **Block 2:** Conv2D (64 filters, 3x3) -> Conv2D (64 filters, 3x3) -> MaxPool2D (2x2)
    3.  **Block 3:** Conv2D (128 filters, 3x3) -> Conv2D (128 filters, 3x3) -> MaxPool2D (2x2)
    4.  **Block 4:** Conv2D (256 filters, 3x3) -> Conv2D (256 filters, 3x3) -> MaxPool2D (2x2)
    5.  **Block 5:** Conv2D (512 filters, 3x3) -> Conv2D (512 filters, 3x3) -> MaxPool2D (2x2)
    6.  **Dropout:** `Dropout(0.25)`
    7.  **Flatten:** `Flatten()`
    8.  **Dense:** `Dense(1500, activation='relu')`
    9.  **Dropout:** `Dropout(0.4)`
    10. **Output:** `Dense(38, activation='softmax')`
* **Optimizer:** `Adam` (learning rate = `0.0001`)
* **Loss Function:** `categorical_crossentropy`

## Performance

The model was trained for 10 epochs and demonstrated strong performance.

* **Final Training Accuracy:** 97.82%
* **Final Validation Accuracy:** 94.59%

## 🚀 How to Run This Project

Follow these steps to set up and run the project on your local machine.

### 1. Prerequisites

* [Python 3.8+](https://www.python.org/)
* [Git](https://git-scm.com/)

### 2. Clone Repository
```bash
git clone [https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/YOUR_REPOSITORY_NAME.git](https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/YOUR_REPOSITORY_NAME.git)
cd YOUR_REPOSITORY_NAME
```
### 3. Set Up Virtual Environment

It's highly recommended to use a virtual environment.

# Since you're on Windows
```bash
python -m venv venv
venv\Scripts\activate
```
### 4. Install Dependencies

Place your requirements.txt file in the root of your project. Then, run the following command:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
### 5. Download Dataset & Model
Dataset: Download the New Plant Diseases Dataset from Kaggle. Extract it and ensure you have the train and valid folders in your project directory.

Trained Model: You must have the trained_plant_disease_model.keras file. You can either:

Run the training notebook (.ipynb file) yourself to generate it.

(If you've already trained it) Place the trained_plant_disease_model.keras file in the root directory.

### 6. Run the Streamlit App
Once the dependencies are installed and the model file is in place, run the Streamlit app:

```Bash

streamlit run main.py
```
This will start a local web server. Open your browser and go to the URL shown in your terminal (usually http://localhost:8501).

How to Use the App
Navigate to http://localhost:8501.

Use the sidebar to select the "Disease Recognition" page.

Click "Choose an Image:" to upload an image of a plant leaf.

Click the "Predict" button.

The app will display the predicted disease name below the button.
