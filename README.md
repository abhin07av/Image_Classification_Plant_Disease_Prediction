Plant Disease Recognition System

This project is a complete deep learning pipeline for identifying 38 different classes of plant diseases from leaf images. It uses a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) built with TensorFlow/Keras and includes a user-friendly web application created with Streamlit for real-time predictions.

Features

High-Accuracy Model: A deep CNN trained on over 70,000 images, achieving 94.6% validation accuracy.

38 Classes: Identifies a wide variety of diseases across 14 different plant types, including Apple, Corn, Grape, Potato, and Tomato.

Interactive Web App: An easy-to-use Streamlit interface allows users to upload their own plant leaf images and receive instant predictions.

Detailed Evaluation: The model's performance is thoroughly analyzed with accuracy/loss plots, a per-class classification report, and a confusion matrix.

Dataset

The model was trained on the New Plant Diseases Dataset available on Kaggle. This dataset contains 87,000+ RGB images of healthy and diseased crop leaves.

How to Run This Project

Follow these steps to set up and run the project on your local machine.

1. Prerequisites

Python 3.8+

Git

2. Clone Repository

git clone [https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/YOUR_REPOSITORY_NAME.git](https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/YOUR_REPOSITORY_NAME.git)
cd YOUR_REPOSITORY_NAME


3. Set Up Virtual Environment

It's highly recommended to use a virtual environment.

# Windows
python -m venv venv
venv\Scripts\activate

# macOS/Linux
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate


4. Install Dependencies

Place the requirements.txt file (containing the exact versions you provided) in the root of your project. Then, run the following command:

pip install -r requirements.txt


5. Download Dataset & Model

Dataset: Download the New Plant Diseases Dataset from Kaggle. Extract it and ensure you have the train and valid folders in your project directory.

Trained Model: You must have the trained_plant_disease_model.keras file. You can either:

Run the training notebook (.ipynb file) yourself to generate it.

(If you've already trained it) Place the trained_plant_disease_model.keras file in the root directory.

6. Run the Streamlit App

Once the dependencies are installed and the model file is in place, run the Streamlit app:

streamlit run main.py


This will start a local web server. Open your browser and go to the URL shown in your terminal (usually http://localhost:8501).

How to Use the App

Navigate to http://localhost:8501.

Use the sidebar to select the "Disease Recognition" page.

Click "Choose an Image:" to upload an image of a plant leaf.

Click the "Predict" button.

The app will display the predicted disease name below the button.
